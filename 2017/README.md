# advent-of-code 2017
These are my solutions written in JavaScript using NodeJS to solve [Advent of Code 2017](http://adventofcode.com/2017) puzzles.

 ## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.
They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code.
Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme.


## Running

These solutions is written with NodeJS 4 and ES6, so you need to have NodeJS 4, at least, for running these solutions.
